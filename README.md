# Rugby Union Results

I took data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lylebegbie/international-rugby-union-results-from-18712022/), which gives me data for all the rugby union matches from 1871-2023.

In this repository, I look to predict/model the difference between the home team score and the away team score to see if there is an advantage to playing at home. 

I have an R-markdown file and a Juptyer notebook that do the exact same thing as I am currently more confident in R, hence started there. Yet, I want to enhance my Python skills so I tried to replicate it as best as I could in Python to understand how the two are similar. 

The results.csv file is the original dataset.
