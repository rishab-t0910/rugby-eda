# Rugby Union Results

I took data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lylebegbie/international-rugby-union-results-from-18712022/), which gives me data for all the rugby union matches from 1871-2023.

In this repository, I look to predict/model the difference between the home team score and the away team score to see if there is an advantage to playing at home.
